/* gcc -o Hello Hello.c */

gcc print warnings without compile
I'd like gcc to do source code analysis for errors, but do not write any output files (similarly to what splint does). I've found this solution currently:
gcc -Wall -c source.c > NUL
Well, you could redirect the output to /dev/null
gcc -o /dev/null ...
There is -fsyntax-only option, which means exactly what you want:

    "Check the code for syntax errors, but donâ€™t do anything beyond that."
