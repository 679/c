   Valgrind is an instrumentation framework for building dynamic analysis tools. It comes with a set of tools each of which performs some kind of debugging, profiling, or similar task that helps you improve your programs. Valgrindâ€™s architecture is modular, so new tools can be created easily and without disturbing the existing structure.
